# Automatic-Garage-door-opner (IOT) :

It is a electrical circuit made digitally with the help of Audinio and tinkercad website to open the door of the garage when the car reaches a certain distance from the garage door and closes it after a delay of fixed time by making use of ultrasonic sensor and C++ code

### Ultasonic Sensor :
- It uses ultrasonic waves to determine the distance from an object
- Formula : `distance = (duration/2)*velocity of sound`
- Range of a ultrasonic sensor is `2cm to 4m`
- Measuring angle is 15 degree
- Working current is 15 mAmphere
- We get pulses from ultrasonic sensor
